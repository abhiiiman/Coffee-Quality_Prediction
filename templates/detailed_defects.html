                <h2>Blackened Beans</h2>
                <p>Blackened beans are caused by over-roasting or exposure to excessive heat during processing. They result in a
                    burnt flavor and bitterness, negatively impacting the taste of the coffee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Sour Beans</h2>
                <p>Sour beans develop a sharp, unpleasant taste due to fermentation during processing. This defect leads to
                    acidity and sourness in the coffee, affecting its overall flavor profile.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Under-ripe Beans</h2>
                <p>Under-ripe beans are not fully developed and lack sweetness. They contribute to a sour and grassy taste in
                    the coffee, diminishing its flavor quality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Over-ripe Beans</h2>
                <p>Over-ripe beans are overly mature and may exhibit a fermented or alcoholic taste. They can cause off-flavors
                    and spoil the overall taste experience of the coffee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Moldy Beans</h2>
                <p>Moldy beans develop mold due to improper storage or exposure to moisture. They impart a musty and unpleasant
                    flavor to the coffee, making it undrinkable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Insect-Damaged Beans</h2>
                <p>Insect-damaged beans have been infested by pests, resulting in physical damage and a sour or musty taste.
                    They compromise the quality and safety of the coffee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Fermented Beans</h2>
                <p>Fermented beans undergo excessive fermentation, leading to a strong, vinegar-like taste. This defect ruins
                    the flavor balance and aroma of the coffee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Flat Beans</h2>
                <p>Flat beans lack the characteristic shape and texture of normal coffee beans. They produce a weak and insipid
                    brew with little aroma or flavor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Chipped Beans</h2>
                <p>Chipped beans have fractured or broken surfaces, exposing the inner bean to oxidation and degradation. They
                    contribute to a bitter and unpleasant taste in the coffee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Broken Beans</h2>
                <p>Broken beans are fragmented or shattered into smaller pieces, increasing surface area and accelerating
                    spoilage. They result in a lower-quality brew with a harsh and astringent flavor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Stinker Beans</h2>
                <p>Stinker beans emit foul odors due to bacterial contamination or fermentation. They impart a rotten or putrid
                    taste to the coffee, rendering it undrinkable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Hull Fragments</h2>
                <p>Hull fragments are remnants of the coffee cherry hull left on the bean after processing. They may add
                    unwanted bitterness and astringency to the coffee if not removed properly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="defect">
                <h2>Mottled Beans</h2>
                <p>Mottled beans have uneven coloration or spotting, indicating inconsistent ripening or processing. They result
                    in a brew with uneven flavor and texture, reducing overall quality.</p>
